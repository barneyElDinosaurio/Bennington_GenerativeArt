### Assignment week 9

This week we continued with the sound library in p5.js, learning how to make sine/square wave oscillators and apply reverb to them, as well as a basic sequencer and arpeggiator. We have next week off, so this week the homework will be more open-ended. Please do all of the following assignments.

1) Make a cool new musical instrument!  

Some ways of how to mash up ideas from this week's class. Feel free to implement these or make something from scratch.
 - Instead of using the sequencer to playback samples, repurpose it to play back different arpeggio sequences.
 - Add a visual component to the arpeggiator, e.g. what if the current pitch or set of pitches were mapped to parameters in one of our visuals sketches.
 - Edit the sequencer so that you can change the speed.
 - Add filters to the sounds going through the sequencer (like the reverb).

2) Make one brand new program from scratch, combining any two of the things we learned in class into one coherent sketch.  This is very open-ended. Be creative! Try mashing up ideas in simple or silly ways. If you don't know where to start, e-mail me and I will make suggestions.

 - Please produce one sketch for #2 and send it along with #1.

3) Review previous weeks of material and start thinking about your final projects.

 - If you know what you want to do for your final project, note it down and start writing down questions you need to answer to figure out all the components needed to make it happen.
 - If you don't know what you want to do, that's OK! We will use the next two classes to meet individually to get ideas for final projects.
 - If you don't know what you want to do, look at previous classes and make notes of what you liked and didn't like, and I can make suggestions of things to research based on this.


#### Final projects planning

I will make time to meet with all of you individually starting with the next class. I will e-mail you all sometime before then to start scheduling.  Have a good plan day week!
