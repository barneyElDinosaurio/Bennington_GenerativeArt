### Assignment week 8

This week we introduced the sound library in p5.js.  Please do the following assignment, which will involve handing in two programs.

We learned how to measure the amplitude of a sound source. Look back on all the previous code examples we made, as well as the assignments. Pick one of the sketches we made or a previous assignment, and change it so that it is audioreactive, where one (or better yet, more than one!) of the parameters are mapped to the volume of a sound source. The sound source can either be coming from the microphone or from a sample clip. Depending on the parameters you select, it may be a good idea to smooth the volume using lerp() so that it isn't abrupt, but that's up to you.

Secondly, we learned how to use measuring the amplitude as a trigger for an event to occur. Similar to the first half of this assignment, find *another* (different from the first one) sketch or assignment we worked with, and create an "event" where some properties of the sketch change suddenly in response to a sudden burst in the volume.

Lastly, please note that it is perfectly acceptable -- indeed even suggested/recommended! -- to make a completely new sketch from scratch for either or both of these, and make it audioreactive.
