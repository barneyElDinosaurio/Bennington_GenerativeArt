### Assignment week 11

This week we introduced the somewhat buggy 3d and the DOM library.  Assignment is short this week, take some time to begin thinking more about final projects and please schedule a time to meet with me next week if you haven't already.


#### DOM game

Make a in-browser game making use of the DOM manipulation and inputs (sliders, text boxes, etc). The game can be simple and silly but must be interactive with the user and browser -- perhaps the user answers a random question and depending on the logic of the program, some new HTML content is created from it.  Be silly and humorous and use the CSS style functionality to make it look cool!
